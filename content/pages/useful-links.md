This is a list of links that I think are useful or interesting.

* A [great matplotlib tutorial](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures/blob/master/Lecture-4-Matplotlib.ipynb) that introduces both fundamental and advanced commands.

* A good [python string format cookbook](https://mkaz.tech/python-string-format.html) that introduces basic python string formating.

* Two good articles talking about [Homebrew installation](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/03/03/homebrew/) and [some tips](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/03/18/keeping-homebrew-date/) 

* An [informative introduction](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/) of jupyter notebook magic commands.
